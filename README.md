## Technical Stack
This is our final project for Advanced Software Engineering class at University of Information Technology. It was developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node,js) with some Progressive Web Apps features.

### Server-side:
#### Node.js

[Node.js®](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a JavaScript runtime built on [Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine](https://developers.google.com/v8/). Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

#### Express

[Express](https://expressjs.com/) is a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

#### MongoDB

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a document database with the scalability and flexibility that you want with the querying and indexing that you need.

### Client-side:
#### React (ft. Redux)
![enter image description here](http://richcostello.github.io/am1port/assets/images/content/react_redux_logo.png)  
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

### PWAs Features:
- Responsive, App-Like
- Install on Homescreen
- Offine Accessibility
